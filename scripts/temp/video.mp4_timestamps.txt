00:00 - 00:06: Hi there, I'm going to show you one of the most popular ways to tie a tie.
00:06 - 00:12: Using the Windsor knot Also known as a double Windsor
00:12 - 00:18: of full windsor. Start with your collar up and the tie around your neck. If you're right-handed...
00:18 - 00:24: Hold the wide end in your right hand and the narrow end in your left hand.
00:24 - 00:30: It's important to remember that the longer you make the wide end, the lower the tie will hang when you've finished.
00:30 - 00:36: Basically, you'll want to line up your tyre like this. If you remember this, you'll save yourself a lot of time later on.
00:36 - 00:42: Now, cross each end over, wide end over the top.
00:42 - 00:48: and leave about this much on the narrow end, that's about 4 inches or 10 centimetres.
00:48 - 00:54: With your left hand, take the wide end, thread it through
00:54 - 01:00: the back of this opening from behind. Thread it all the way through like this.
01:00 - 01:06: 
01:06 - 01:12: Now take the wide end, and with your left hand, round it out.
01:12 - 01:18: it all the way around the back like this. Switch hands. Notice here how
01:18 - 01:24: the back of the tie is facing outward.
01:24 - 01:30: Taking the wide end now in your right hand, thread it through the front of this opening. We're going through the front.
01:30 - 01:36: front and down this time. Thread it through all the way down like this. Alright!
01:36 - 01:42: The hardest part's now done. The rest is easy. What you can see here is the inside of your knot.
01:42 - 01:48: look a bit like a triangle. Put your left index finger on the knot like this.
01:48 - 01:54: and keep it there. With your other hand, wrap the wide end around the knot from right to left.
01:54 - 02:00: lift, and then grab it from behind. Keep your index finger where it is.
02:00 - 02:06: With your right hand, push the wide end through this opening.
02:06 - 02:12: opening again from the back so we're coming up and through the back like this threading it through the hole
02:12 - 02:18: Alright, here comes the punchline.
02:18 - 02:24: Your index finger has created a little tunnel, what you need to do now is thread the tie down
02:24 - 02:30: through the tunnel, and pull it down. The last tip...
02:30 - 02:36: now is to adjust and tighten it, alternating between the long end and the short end, gradually
02:36 - 02:42: Pulling the knot up, shaping it as you go, until it's just how you want it to be. A sharp circle.
02:42 - 02:48: symmetrical triangular knot. Pull your collar down and bingo!
02:48 - 02:54: full Windsor knot. Thank you for watching. I hope you found this helpful.
02:54 - 03:00: you
